> Yet another man.


I am a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo Faculty of Mathematics. I was born in Yangzhou, China in 1997 and brought up in the same city. One of my favourite places in Yangzhou is my high school, in which I joined the school Olympiad in Informatics team and found my passion about technology.

What fascinated me the most is that technology has great power in making people's lives better. I am passionate about programming and I strive for excellence in each project I took while learning as much as possible along the way.

When I'm not working or serving open-source duties, I like to take photos and spread my love in photography. I am also into planes that I spot, ride, and even in the process of learning to fly them. I also love talking to different people, discussing ideas and travelling.
